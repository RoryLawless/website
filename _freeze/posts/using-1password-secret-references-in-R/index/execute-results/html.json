Not only is it risky to store them in plaintext, it’s also a nightmarish way to manage and rotate out keys when needed.\n\n## 1Password to the rescue\n\n1Password offers a great solution for managing sensitive data. It even has a dedicated API Credentials item type for people super into taxonomy. The desktop and mobile apps are great for day-to-day internet usage but the real magic happens when you introduce yourself to [1Password CLI and its handy secret references](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-reference-syntax) feature.\n\nI won't go into detail on installation and configuration, [the documentation does a better job than I ever could](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started). However, once you have added an API key to 1Password, you can refer to it using its URI (also called a Secret Reference) instead of including it as plaintext in your .Renviron or R script. The URI of a credential comes in this format:\n\n``` {#uri-example style=\"text-align: center;\"}\nop://<vault-name>/<item-name>/[section-name/]<field-name>\n```\n\nFor example, an Anthropic API key saved as an item named \"ClaudeAPI\" inside our \"Private\" vault with the value in a field called \"credential\" can be referred to using the URI `op://Private/ClaudeAPI/credential` (note, the `[section-name/]` element is only required if the field is under a named section within the item). The URI of your credential can then replace the plain text key in your .Renviron or anywhere else it was lurking. Using our ClaudeAPI example, the entry in .Renviron would look like:\n\n``` {#envvar-example style=\"text-align: center;\"}\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"op://Private/ClaudeAPI/credential\"\n```\n\n## Out of 1Password, into R\n\nOur key is now stored inside our 1Password vault, safe from prying eyes and accidental exposure. In our less secure days, we would typically run `{{r}} Sys.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")` to access the value of the environment variable in a script. While this still works, any API call that uses this value will likely fail as the value returned is the literal URI string, not the secret.\n\nTo address this, we need to alter the code in two ways. The first is to use one of [the methods 1Password CLI provides](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secrets-scripts) for loading secrets into code, the one we will use in our R script is `op read`. This simply allows us to read the secret into our environment.\n\nThe second change, calling the function `{{r}} system2()` from {base}, lets us run `op read` (indeed, any system command) from our R script and returns the actual API key.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsystem2(\n\t\"op\",\n\targs = c(\"read\", shQuote(Sys.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))),\n\tstdout = TRUE\n)\n\n# Note, our call to Sys.getenv() needs to be quoted using shQuote() to mitigate issues with spaces and special characters\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen we execute the example code, 1Password will prompt us to approve access to the secret (illustrated in @fig-authimage). Once we click \"Authorize\", the secret value is returned as a character vector (setting `stdout = TRUE` in `system2()` makes this happen).\n\n![1Password CLI prompt for secret access](20260102-1password-prompt.png){#fig-authimage fig-alt=\"A screenshot of a 1Password prompt to 'Allow Positron to get CLI access' with the option to 'Cancel' or 'Authorize'.\" width=\"390\"}\n\nWe can alter the above code to assign a name to the returned character vector or we can run the function call directly within the API call function. Furthermore, we can jettison `Sys.getenv()` entirely and pass the URI directly, like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsystem2(\n\t\"op\",\n\targs = c(\"read\", shQuote(\"op://Private/ClaudeAPI/credential\")),\n\tstdout = TRUE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nDoing this potentially comes with extra work if you choose to change the name of the item in 1Password but this alternative is there as an option, especially if you're playing around with your code and are not yet ready to commit to setting an environment variable.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nAdmittedly, this does add some extra steps to workflows (not to mention some unsightly code), however, this trade-off is worth it for the privacy and security benefits it offers. Moreover, the increased cognitive load of switching out expired keys is abated somewhat as we can update secrets in a single place, a 1Password vault, without touching our R scripts or environment. This is especially helpful if you use these secrets across multiple contexts.",
